1. build a V1 model to predict probability of hire from conversations


# steps
- labels -> hire... manually analyze
- use it for base price refresh

# week 1 stuff
- read the Intent Playbook (1h)
- read the data and label it
- look through all the hires and determine Regex or NLP rules

# first day
- 1:15 - 2:30pm (1h) and plan questions for Yi
	- download data as csv
	- put into Jupyter notebook
	- look at hires
- 3 to 3:30pm
- 

# Questions
- what's a calibration file?


# tools 
- fastText

# Insights
- determine which step we should price the pro
- maybe it's in the third message rather than the first contact
- when there is intent to hire


do this by tomorrow:
- regex rules that have high precision 95%+
- use more words as opposed to one
- find as many of the rules as possible
- do it in Python Regex syntax as opposed to what it is now...

another dataframe just for rules


- I think also doing a sentiment anlaysis will be really helpful for p(hire)
