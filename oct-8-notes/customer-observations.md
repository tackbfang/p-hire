# Overall Observations
- giving an address is pretty good
- a lot of people are confused about how to mark as hire
	- why don't we just have a strong UI for hired as opposed to guessing?
- some I don't think are hires
- the overall hire rate is smaller, because not all pros will accept.


# Tech
- use NLP techniques
- wordcloud
- fastText / neural text classification
